Today on Monday 22 January 2024 23:40 PM SAST I have finalley made a breakthrough!!!!!

I have proven my theory to be plausable!!!!!!!!

Print communication and ping with hostname now working.

Print_Server web User Interface works accross all platforms and is mobile friendly as well as supports ios9 devices and Windows 7.

Using the Print_Server's built-in web UI I have successfully executed my first driverless test print using ipp protocol through my local network.

I call this the X-factor test.

Still have a lot of work ahead of me.

Lets me celebrate by rewarding myself a well earned night's sleep.

I haven't slept for 72 hours.

Yes I have been coding for 3 days straight if I include breaks.....
